# :man_technologist: About Me :
👋 Hi, I’m Rickey — a DoD-cleared Systems Administrator transitioning into cybersecurity. My GitHub documents my journey as I expand beyond Windows Server and VMware into threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response, while continuing to leverage my background in enterprise IT.
*    🔐 Cybersecurity Labs: Building hands-on projects aligned with CompTIA CySA+ — including SIEM log analysis (ELK), Microsoft Defender for Cloud misconfiguration testing, and vulnerability scanning.
*	 ☁️ Cloud & Identity: Deploying and securing Azure resources (VMs, VNets, Storage) while administering Entra ID (Azure AD), Intune, and Microsoft 365 with a focus on identity protection and endpoint security.
*	 ⚙️ Automation: Scripting with PowerShell and Azure CLI to streamline provisioning, patching, and remediation tasks.
*	 🧠 Continuous Learning: Using homelabs to strengthen skills in security monitoring, incident response, and hybrid cloud defense.
